This is just a fun question to get you started on using git. The answer isn't important. Changing a file and commiting it to git is, though.

Here's the first problem:

As I was going to St Ives
I met a man with seven wives
Every wife had seven sacks
Every sack had seven cats
Every cat had seven kits
Kittens, cats, sacks, wives.
How many were going to St Ives?
